    Knowing to be firing six out of seven days a week. Morro Bay can hold a lot of swell before getting maxed out. Although it is sensitive to wind it can hold with a 3 knot south, south west. Also known to be better on a mid range tide. Anything negative the waves will be mshy and hard to catch. Best conditions are mid range tide, slight southeast wind under 3 knots, and a west northwest swell at a 15 second swell period. Also holds small south swells well. Any swell over 8-10 ft will most likely max out this spot so be weary. The localism here is slight to none and have no fear paddling out 20+ or more. Another distinct Morro Bay attribute is the party wave call. Calling “Party Wave!” before catching a wave allows everyone to catch and share the wave. This is only for Morro.
