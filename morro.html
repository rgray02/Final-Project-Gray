    <p>
    Known to be firing six out of seven days a week, Morro Bay can hold a large amount of swell before maxing out. Although it is sensitive to wind this surf spot can hold up to a 3 knot south, south west wind pattern. Ideal conditions at this spot are mid range tide, slight southeast wind under 3 knots, and a west northwest swell at a 15 second swell period. Also known to hold small south swells well. Any swell over 8-10 ft will most likely max out this spot so be weary. The localism here is slight to none and have no fear paddling out with 20+ people or more. Another distinct Morro Bay attribute is the party wave call. Calling “Party Wave!” before catching a wave allows everyone to catch and share the wave. This is only for Morro.

<div class="surfspot">THE ROCK</div>
<div class="paragraphtext"><p>
The Rock is a more specific surf spot in Morro Bay. The rock is defined as the surf spot right next to the rock. To get to The Rock parking lot just take Embarcadero Road until it dead ends at the big rock and you will have arrived. The Rock can be good under multiple situations. If you are on your longboard you would most likely surf it with a 1-3 foot swell on a 15 second interval. The Rock is not as temperamental to wind as other spots because of the protection the Rock itself provides. It can hold a wind current of 5 knots to the south to south west. Best for beginners to expert. Can be a left or right beach break.</p></div>
