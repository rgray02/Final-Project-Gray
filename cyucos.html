    <P>
    Come shred the pier! Known to be very temperamental to wind, Cayucos is a great spot for beginners looking to get their shred on! Cayucos is known to be able to handle a lot of swell not maxing out till 10+ ft. Because of Cayucos geographical location of being set back in almost a cove, it takes a lot of swell to push through and max out this spot.The pier is known to have an encouraging crowd, great for those just getting into surfing. The pier is best on a north, north south swell with a 11 second swell period. Also does well with east, southeast winds under 5 knots.

Found on Studio Drive just north of Morro bay is the wave Studios. Studios is a sand bottom beach break A-frame. Studios does best on mid-range combo swells like 5-6 ft north, northwest swell direction or south, south east swell direction. Although parking can be limited at times the whole road of Studio Drive will generally be good. Parking is permitted as long as you are not in front of a mailbox. </p></div>

<div class="surfspot">19 <sup>th</sup> STREET</div>
<div class="paragraphtext"><p>
19 <sup>th</sup> Street can be found on the very southern end of the city of Cayucos. The wave is located along 19<sup>th</sup>street and is a beach break A-frame. 19<sup>th</sup> Street does well on smaller sized south swells. It is best on a low to mid range tide rising. Because it is a beach break it will normally be best after a large storm. Storms are what you want to shift the sandbars to improve the shape of the wave.</p></div>
