    Come shred the pier! Known to be very temperamental to wind, Cayucos is a great spot for beginners looking to get their shred on! Cayucos is knowing to be able to handle a lot of swell not maxing out till 10+ ft. Because of Cayucos geographical location of being set back in almost a cove it takes a lot of swell to push through and max out this spot.The pier is known to have an encouraging crowd great for those just getting into surfing. The pier is best on a north, north south swell with a 11 second swell period. Also does well with east, southeast winds under 5 knots.
